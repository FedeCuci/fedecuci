I am an Entrepreneurship & Business Innovation student at Tilburg University, Netherlands. I think I have quite a unique relationship to programming and to the world of computer science and just below I will briefly talk about my story in this space.

I first became exposed to programming at 11 years old just after I moved to the Netherlands from my home country, Italy. I started by making extremely simple blog posts using HTML and Blogspot. I was always fascinated by sharing my learnings with the rest of the world through the Internet. In grade 6, our school provided us with our personal laptops that had to remain at school, and just a year later, we were allowed to take them home. It was then that the Macbook Air 2012 (13 inch) became my very first personal laptop. I was extremely excited by this and I wanted to find everything that I could do with it. After a while

After having opened my Youtube channel on very basic programming concepts, I was almost expelled from my school and from there I stopped doing these things for a while. In those years I have always tried to work on personal projects such as Spalaxys, a browser-based game built in JS and PhaserJS, which unfortunately did not get very far. 

In 2017 I became very interested in Bitcoin, and immersed myself in the Blockchain world. At first I mainly just invested money into different coins but then I started enjoying learning about the Blocksize Wars, governance discussions etc.

Soon after I started Technical Computer Science at Twente University, where unfortunately I dropped out after just 4 months because the pandemic was making the study extremely difficult to follow.

In 2020, during the lockdown, I kept myself busy by installing Linux on my main machine and tweaking many parts of the OS. I tried a few distros, (Ubuntu, Fedora, yeah not the hardcore ones...) and ran Linux for about 7 months as my machine OS until I accidentally broke something and lost a lot of my files. It was also during this time where I learnt a lot about open-source software and became fascinated by it.

Most of my contributions 


creating GameMaker games when I was around 11 or 12. I enjoyed it, but I didn't fully understand how the programs I was making worked. I am now learning a variety of programming topics, always starting from the simplest working concepts so that I can confidently explain every step of the process to myself and anyone who happens to run my code.
