My name is Federico Cucinotta and I was born on the 6th of May 2002 in Reggio Emilia, Italy. Currently, I am a student of Entrepreneurship & Business Innovation at Tilburg University, Netherlands. I think I have quite a unique relationship to programming and to the world of computer science and just below I will briefly talk about my story in this space.

## My story in the world of programming and computer science

I first became exposed to programming at 11 just after I moved to the Netherlands from my home country, Italy. I started by learning HTML, CSS and JS from Codecademy and making extremely simple blog posts using HTML and Blogspot. I was always fascinated by sharing my learnings with the rest of the world through the Internet. In grade 6, just a year later, our school provided us with our personal laptops that we were allowed to take home. It was then that the Macbook Air 2012 (13 inch) became my very first personal laptop and where my journey began.

My main interest has always been in 'hacking', it's just what excited me the most and motivated me to learn. I soon realized that because we all had Apple laptops at school, there were some interesting things that I could do. I started making Applescript scripts to try and phish some of my classmates, shutdown their computers, make them say things etc. always just for fun. I soon realized Applescript was very limited so I looked into other programming languages at the time such as ObjectiveC, Swift, JS etc. but I ended up with Python. This is where I fell in love with the language, started making simple scripts and even opened a Youtube channel to share what I learned. Because of some problems that happened with the school that I got accused of, they forced me to take my Youtube channel down or I would be expelled.

So, I decided to work on other projects in my free time where my classmates, teachers etc. were not involved. To gain back the trust from the teachers, I decided to build a harvard reference generator (like Neils toolbox) with the school's branding. I built a very basic version for the web using HTML, CSS and JS and another one using Python and Tkinter. I also hosted the web version on a VPS, but unfortunately the school never ended up using it.

After this I spent most of my time learning about cyber security again, where I learned about the shell, Linux, reverse shells etc. Many times I just watched Youtube tutorials and try to replicate them which often didn't work. One of the most fun times was making a reverse shell in Python that would connect to a remote CC server where I could control other people's computers. Reverse shells always interested me because of their 'reverse' logic, where it is the victim connecting to you instead of the other way around.

After some time, I was interested to learn about Gamedev so I looked for team members on teamups.net to try and make our very own .io game, which were extremely popular at the time. With a classmate and a small remote team, we decided to make the game similar to moomoo.io but based in space. We used JS and PhaserJS, but we did not realize that we were way underskilled for such a project and therefore left it.

In 2017 I became very interested in Bitcoin, and immersed myself in the Blockchain world. At first I mainly just invested small amounts of money into different coins but then I started enjoying learning about the Blocksize Wars, governance arguments, altcoins etc. I did not do any practical projects with blockchain as it kept being a rather abstract topic for me so I just stuck to reading whitepapers of interesting crypto companies.

In 2018, I did a 6-month-long project for school on building my very own alarm system with Arduino. This is where I learned a lot about different types of sensors, electric circuits, pins, soldering etc. However, although I learned a ton from it, I understood that it was not my favorite field. 

After the project I soon started working with the raspberry pi, trying to build a portable Kali Machine. I wanted to learn more about Cyber Security.

In 2019, I decided to create my very own "Computer Science" course for high school students at school. The school agreed that I could do this as a private activity and get paid for it which I never thought possible. I took my lessons very seriously and tried to teach my students all the things I learned in the past 8 years of self-teaching so they could avoid the mistakes I had made. This is certainly one of the projects I am most proud of.

In 2020, during the lockdown, I kept myself busy by installing Linux on my main machine and tweaking many parts of the OS. I tried a few distros, (Ubuntu, Fedora, yeah not the hardcore ones...) and ran Linux as my main OS for about 7 months until I accidentally broke something and lost a lot of my files. It was also during this time where I learnt a lot about open-source software and became fascinated by it. I never had the skills to contribute to code in a project, but I did my best at opening issues in the projects that I used. 

Soon after I started Technical Computer Science at Twente University, where unfortunately I dropped out after just 4 months because the pandemic was making the study extremely difficult to follow for me. Although I didn't have time to learn much, it was still a valuable experience nonetheless.

I realized that after quitting computer science at university, there is no way for me to show my experience in programming so I decided to get certified in at least Python programming at the 'Associate' level from OpenEDG. 

Now I am studying Entrepreneurship & Business Innovation, and although I love the study, I do miss not being as close to the world of software and technology anymore. The closest thing I do to this now is to learn about blockchain more in depth and attend local conferences in this space. Blockchain is currently the technology that interests me the most. 

However, it is my goal to go back to programming and keep studying further in the future. Specifically, I want to improve my skills in writing real-life and application-ready code. I have the basic understandings of the concepts behind programming languages, especially Python, but have always limited myself to creating scripts as proof of concept instead of usable solutinos. It is not my intention to become a professional software developer, but I would like to take my programming skills to the next level.
