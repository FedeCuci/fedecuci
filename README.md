## Hi!

I am Fede, and I am currently a student of Entrepreneurship & Business Innovation at Tilburg University, the Netherlands. I love to keep myself busy by working on personal projects. Not all of my work is uploaded to my Github profile, and I am still in the process of making my projects more readable on Github. If you would like to take a look at what I have worked on over the years, feel free to browse!
